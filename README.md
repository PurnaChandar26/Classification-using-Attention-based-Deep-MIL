# Classification using Attention-based Deep MIL
This repository contains code and resources for performing classification using Attention-based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how attention mechanisms can be incorporated into deep MIL models for improved classification performance.

## Overview
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a machine learning framework where the training data consists of bags, each containing multiple instances. Traditional MIL approaches typically treat bags as positive or negative based on the presence or absence of at least one positive instance. However, this binary assumption may not accurately represent the underlying distribution of instances within the bags.

Attention-based MIL models address this limitation by using attention mechanisms to assign importance weights to individual instances within each bag. By considering the relevance of each instance during training, attention-based MIL models can achieve better classification performance by focusing on the most informative instances.

This repository provides an implementation of the Attention-based Deep MIL model, which incorporates attention mechanisms into a deep neural network architecture. The model is trained on labeled bags of instances and can be used to classify new unseen bags.
